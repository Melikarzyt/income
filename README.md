ðŸ“Œ Income Prediction using Decision Tree

ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether an individual earns more than $50,000 per year based on demographic and work-related attributes from the U.S. Census dataset. The main objective is to build a machine learning model that can effectively identify high-income individuals.
We chose a Decision Tree Classifier as the primary algorithm due to its interpretability and ability to handle both categorical and numerical features. Model performance was measured using the F1-score, with special emphasis on the high-income class (>50K).

âœ… Tasks Completed
	â€¢	Data Exploration: Inspected dataset structure, checked data types, and ensured no missing values remained untreated.
	â€¢	Data Cleaning:
	â€¢	Removed irrelevant or non-informative columns such as fnlwgt.
	â€¢	Replaced ambiguous entries (?) in categorical columns with the most frequent value.
	â€¢	Encoding: Converted categorical features into numerical values using LabelEncoder.
	â€¢	Feature Engineering:
	â€¢	Created new features such as capital_diff (capital gain minus capital loss).
	â€¢	Introduced a binary feature is_over_40_hours to capture work-hour intensity.
	â€¢	Model Training: Trained a Decision Tree Classifier with tuned hyperparameters (max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, and criterion).
	â€¢	Model Evaluation:
	â€¢	Generated a classification report on the training data.
	â€¢	Focused on F1-score for the >50K class, achieving 0.69, which indicates reasonable predictive power for identifying high-income individuals.
	â€¢	Submission File: Created a clean, single-column CSV file containing predictions on the test set for external evaluation.
